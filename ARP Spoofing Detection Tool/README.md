# ARP Spoofing Detection Tool

This tool detects ARP spoofing attacks by listening for any fake ARP responses on the network. It helps you identify potential ARP spoofing incidents and take appropriate action to safeguard your network and devices. **Note: ARP spoofing detection is an essential security measure to protect against network attacks. Use this tool responsibly and ensure proper authorization when monitoring network activity.**


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x 
- Required Python packages: `scapy`, `argparse`, `sys`, `halo`, `colorama`

## Usage 
1. Clone the repository or download the `arp_spoofing_detector.py` file to your local machine. 
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script. 
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Execute the script using the following command:
```bash
python3 arp_spoofing_detector.py -i <interface>
```
Replace `<interface>` with the network interface that you want to monitor for ARP spoofing attacks (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

**Example:**
```bash
python3 arp_spoofing_detector.py -i eth0
```

The tool will start monitoring the network interface for any ARP responses. If it detects any fake ARP responses, indicating a potential ARP spoofing attack, it will display a warning message.

3. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the monitoring process.

**Warning: Use this tool responsibly and ensure proper authorization when monitoring network activity. ARP spoofing detection helps identify potential threats, but it does not prevent attacks. Implement additional security measures to protect your network and devices. See more in [Networks-Penetration-Testing](https://github.com/Saalehh/Networks-Penetration-Testing)**
