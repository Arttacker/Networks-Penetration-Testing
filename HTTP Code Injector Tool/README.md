## Introduction

As a cybersecurity enthusiast, you understand the importance of identifying vulnerabilities in web applications. The **Code Injector Tool** empowers you to:

- Intercept HTTP responses in real-time.
- Inject custom payloads into responses.
- Modify responses before they reach their destination.
- Test web applications for security flaws.

Enhance your penetration testing toolkit with this versatile and easy-to-use tool.

## Features

- **Response Intercept**: Capture HTTP responses from target applications.
    
- **Payload Injection**: Inject custom payloads into intercepted responses.
    
- **Real-Time Modification**: Modify responses in real-time, allowing for dynamic testing.
    
- **Flexible Configuration**: Specify the interface, payload, and port for the injection.
    

## Prerequisites

Before using the **Code Injector Tool**, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python 3.x**: The script is written in Python 3.
    
- **pip**: The Python package manager for installing dependencies.
    

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeInjector.git`
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd CodeInjector`
    
3. Install required dependencies:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    

## Usage

To use the **Code Injector Tool**, follow these steps:

1. Run the script:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `python code_injector.py -i <interface> --payload <payload> --port <port>`
    
2. Capture and intercept HTTP responses.
    
3. Inject custom payloads into intercepted responses.
    
4. Observe real-time modifications.
    
5. Assess web application security.
    

## Options

- `-l, --local`: Use this option for testing on your local machine or when using [bettercap].
    
- `-i, --interface <interface>`: Specify the network interface for the attack.
    
- `--payload <payload>`: Define the payload you want to inject into HTTP responses.
    
- `--port <port>`: Set the port for listening and transmitting packets.
    

## Examples

- Intercept responses on a local network:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `python code_injector.py -l -i wlan0 --payload malicious.js --port 8080`
    
- Inject a custom JavaScript payload:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `python code_injector.py -i eth0 --payload custom_payload.js --port 80`
