## ARP Spoofing Tool
This tool allows you to intercept and modify network traffic between two hosts by poisoning their ARP caches with forged ARP requests and replies.

## ARP Spoofing Detection Tool
Detects ARP spoofing attacks on your network by monitoring ARP requests and replies for suspicious activity.

## Downloads Redirection Tool
Redirects downloads on the network to a different source, allowing you to replace downloaded files with malicious versions.

## DNS Spoofing Tool
Performs DNS spoofing attacks by intercepting DNS queries and responding with forged DNS replies, redirecting traffic to malicious sites.

## HTTP Packet Sniffing Tool
Captures and analyzes HTTP packets on the network, allowing you to monitor and manipulate HTTP traffic.

## HTTP Code Injector Tool
Injects arbitrary code into HTTP responses, enabling you to modify web pages and inject malicious scripts.

## Network Scanner Python Script
Scans the network to discover active hosts, open ports, and running services, providing a detailed map of the network.

## NetCut Tool
Allows you to cut off network access for specific devices on a network by sending forged ARP requests.

## Mac Changer Python Script
Changes the MAC address of your network interface, allowing you to anonymize your network presence.

## Additional Tools
